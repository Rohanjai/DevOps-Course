Language Model Usage Report

1. The used LLM tool:
   The LLM tool used was GitHub Copilot.

2. Motivation/reason to use LLM:
   The primary motivation for using the LLM was to ensure adherence to good coding practices, improve code quality, and streamline the development process. 
   Additionally, the LLM was used to assist in learning a new programming language (Go) and to replicate an existing service written in Python.

3. How and why LLM helped:
   - In Service 1 and Service 2:
     - The LLM was used to review the code for good coding practices.
     - It assisted in writing comments and function documentation, ensuring clarity and maintainability of the code.
   - In Service 3:
     - The LLM was instrumental in learning Go and replicating the functionality of the Python-based service in Go.
     - It helped identify and fix errors, such as spelling mistakes and incorrect URLs, during the development process.

4. What kind of mistakes LLM did:
   - The LLM occasionally suggested code that was syntactically correct but did not align with the specific requirements of the project.
   - Some recommendations lacked context-specific understanding, leading to suggestions that were not entirely relevant or optimal.

5. What were things that LLM was not able to provide:
   - It was unable to provide comprehensive explanations for certain Go-specific concepts, requiring additional research and learning from external resources.
   - Debugging complex runtime issues or providing insights into performance optimization was beyond its capabilities.

In short i think the LLM proved to be a valuable tool for improving productivity and learning, but its suggestions required careful review and validation to ensure correctness and alignment with project goals.
